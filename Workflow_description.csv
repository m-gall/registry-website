This analytical pipeline has been NATA accredited, as part of KCCGâ€™s clinical accreditation for germline sequencing of DNA from blood. The pipeline is implemented on DNAnexus, a platform as a service that runs on AWS. DNAnexus takes care of data management, security, sharing, access, auditing, and instance management. Each component of the pipeline (eg bwa, HaplotypeCaller, ...) is represented as an individual app, which are threaded together using an in house pipeline generator, which uses the DNAnexus API, and sample metadata to configure custom workflows that are flexible to the structure of the given dataset.
